Run create_db.py once for your semester of interest to create a database of all courses offered for this semester. You
only have to do this once for any given semester, and only if the file for your semester of choice hasn't already been
created (named ID_cab_base where ID is a unique semester ID). It may take a couple minutes.

The pattern for semester IDs is a concatenation of:
        1. First part of the academic year (ex. 2024 for the 2024-2025 academic year)
        2. "00" for Summer, "10" for Fall, "15" for Winter, "20" for Spring
    Examples:
    Fall 2024: 202410
    Winter 2025: 202415
    Spring 2025: 202420

Determining classes that build on a given class ("post-requisites" or at least related) ===============================
1. Set SEM_ID in post_req.py as the id of the semester of interest
2. Set PREREQ_CODE in post_req.py to the class code of interest (formatted as eg. MATH 0100)
3. Repeat steps 1-2 but for SEM_ID of the previous semester, as classes are often "fall" or "spring" classes. Checking
   both Fall and Spring ensures most regularly offered courses are considered.
Note that not all courses listed necessarily have the inputted class as a prerequisite; rather, it only means the
descriptions and/or course registration restrictions on CAB mentioned the class in some way. This could be as a
recommendation, prerequisite, or one of many ways to fulfill the same prerequisite. I recommend you go through each of
the outputted classes to confirm before using the list to make any course selection decisions; this is a starting point.
